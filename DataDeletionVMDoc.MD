### File Creation

First I created eight seperate files four text files and four png files and saved them to various locations in the VM. Each of the text files contain a message that pertains to the technique that was used to delete that file. That way if you can read that line we know you recovered the information in the file. Also the png files have very crude drawings, again having to do with the technique that was used to delete the file.

### Data Deletion

I then used four different techniques to remove these files using each technique on both a txt file and a png file. The four techniques that I used to delete these files were CCleaner file deletion, sdelete, and eraser. Now in the previous line I said four techniques and listed three tools, that is because the eraser tool as multiple options as far as how many passes to make for deletion and I choose to erasure methods the first being called the US Air Force 5020 (3 passes) and the second being the Schneier 7 pass (7 passes).
