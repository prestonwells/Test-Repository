### File Creation

First I created eight seperate files four text files and four png files and saved them to various locations in 
the VM.

### Data Deletion

I then used four different techniques to remove these files using each technique on both a txt file and a png 
file. The four techniques that I used to delete these files were CCleaner file deletion, sdelete, and eraser.
Now in the previous line I said four techniques and listed three tools, that is because the eraser tool as 
multiple options as far as how many passes to make for deletion and I choose to erasure methods the first being 
called the US Air Force 5020 (3 passes) and the second being the Schneier 7 pass (7 passes).
